# Agent Development Notes

This is a Foldkit app. Read [`FOLDKIT.md`](./FOLDKIT.md) before writing any code in this project. It covers the architecture, the APIs, and the conventions the project is built on.

Foldkit owns `FOLDKIT.md` and replaces it whole on upgrade. This file is yours. Anything you want an agent to know about this project goes below, where an upgrade won't touch it.

`FOLDKIT.md` reads the line below to decide whether it has already offered to vendor the Foldkit source. Leave it in place.

## Project Notes

Domain vocabulary, deployment steps, local conventions that differ from Foldkit's defaults: write them here.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues on `jonstuebe/trash` via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
